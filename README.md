# Abstract

Keystroke Dynamics-based biometric identification technologies have been in use for almost 40 years. Identification of people based on their physiological or behavioural characteristics has always attracted a lot of interest. Keystroke Dynamics focuses on the specific way that a person types on a keyboard.

# Objectives

The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate how well users' identities can be verified using this biometric trait and with the addition of contextual data. The proposed study is concerned with free text. Users were never instructed on how, when, or what to type. As compared to the fixed text alternative, where a variety of techniques have been tried, this particular area of keystroke dynamics has not been as thoroughly studied.

# Proposed Methods
The proposed techniques are based on the idea that a letter's or a group of letters' placement within a word has a significant impact. Other studies did not account for whether these letter combinations were found at the start, middle, or end of a word. The context of the written words and the delay between each keystroke will be used to create a template of the user. The effectiveness of various features in determining an individual's identity, including word length, the minimum number of words required for a session to be considered valid, frequency of words, model-building parameters, age group, and gender, has also been investigated.

# Results
The proposed research's findings should be used to assess whether the methodology and Keystroke Dynamics are suitable for reliably identifying users from the text they type. From this point forward, it might be applied as a way to make sure a user isn't replaced, in authentication protocols, or even to help identify the authors of various sections of a document written by multiple users.
